**1 Introduction** <br/>
i) third generation protocol, raising usability of the technology in a practical way <br>
ii) problem of organisational inefficiencies and fragmented practices <br/>
iii) consolidation of organisational tools and practices for streamlined operations<br/>
**2 Architecture**<br/>
i) Application interface and basic functions outline (communication, transparency and permissions, documentation, workflow, KPI, etc.) including security, and back & front end technical brief for each function<br/>
ii) Smart contracts, coding by options practice, templates and components, contract management, stakeholder management, including technical brief of how this is achievable, and cryptography <br/>
iii) Public and permissioned structure, and optimisation (using centralised server for processing of functions where not required on blockchain for cost efficiency <br/>
iv) Technicalities of how the centralised application will connect to blockchain, and scalability for many users.<br/>
**3 Use Cases**<br/>
i) flexibility gained from using both permissioned and public <br/>
ii) public use cases such as trust-less dealings, supply chain, charity, government etc., (how participants, voters, clients, investors will come to demand it’s use, as it’s freely available) including how the application can support it, and if not, ex. in case of supply chain, development of prospective modules.<br/>
**4 Protocol**<br/>
i) incentivisation of developers and templates index/marketplace <br/>
ii) situational procedure templates/automation and how we’ll facilitate organisations to create better user experience in complicated procedures<br/>
iii) benefits of the system as a whole including organisational & international transactions<br/>
iv) source of revenue/monetization (by upgraded services, ad revenue, transaction fees, custom smart contract development, etc)?<br/>
v) Prospective, advanced module development for interactive forms/data and different use cases, mobile application for personal wallet use<br/> vi) roadmap<br/>
**5 Token Issuance**<br/>
i) half of tokens available at Crowdsale <br/>
ii) Allocation over 5 years <br/>
iii) other half of tokens for long term growth <br/>
iv) terms including min and max funding, refund policy activation below min.<br/>
